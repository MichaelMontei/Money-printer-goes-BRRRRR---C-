Learn how to make classes, Create objects and using them, some basic error handling.

First of I started by making a CLient and BankAccount class with the properties that were asked: 
After that we added Logic to the methods.

## Must have Features
A working Client and BankAccount class with some properties and methods in the console. Either hardcoded or with interaction in ReadLine.

The Client class
- A constructor

- Properties:
   - Id
   - Name
   - Date joined

The bank account class
- A constructor

- Properties:
  - Client
  - Balance
  - Type

- Methods:
  - CheckBalance
  - Withdraw
  - Deposit

### The end goal?
In the main function of the program you will create a Client and his/her bankAccount.
Here you will then make different deposits and withdrawals. 

BALANCE MAY NEVER BE LESS THAN ZERO.
